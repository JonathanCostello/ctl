Q(qualaid): You probably qualify as indigent because you receive public assistance. Defendant rebuttably presumed eligible if income is less than 140% of the Federal Poverty
Guideline. MI ST 780.991(3)(b). Receiving certain forms of public assistance creates a rebuttable presumption of eligibility. MI ST 780.991(3)(b)

Q(qualciv): You probably qualify as indigent since you earn less than 140% of the poverty line. See MI ST 780.991(3)(b). Consequently, you may be eligible to have your court fees waived. Would you like me to open up a fee waiver for you to file?
A:[https://apps.suffolklitlab.org/start/indigency] Yes
	Q(3.1): If the affidavit of indigency didn't open in a new window/tab, you can find it <a href="https://apps.suffolklitlab.org/start/indigency">here</a>.

Q(qualcrim): You probably qualify as indigent since you earn less than 140% of the poverty line. So you'll likely be assigned a lawyer by the judge. A defendant is considered to be indigent if he or she is unable, without substantial financial hardship to himself or herself or to his or her dependents, to obtain competent, qualified
legal representation. Substantial financial hardship shall be rebuttably presumed if the defendant receives personal public assistance or earns an income lessthan 140% of the Federal
Poverty Guideline. MI ST 780.991(3)(b)


Q(noqualciv): You probably won't qualify as indigent since you earn more than 140% of the poverty line. See MI ST 780.991(3)(b). So you'll probably need to hire an attorney. Would you like to search for one near you?

	Q(5.1):GOTO:nomore
A: No
	Q(5.2):GOTO:nomore

Q(noqualcrim): You probably won't qualify as indigent or indigent but able to contribute since you earn more than 250% of the poverty line. So you'll probably need to hire an attorney. Would you like to search for one near you?

	Q(6.1):GOTO:nomore
A: No
	Q(6.2):GOTO:nomore
